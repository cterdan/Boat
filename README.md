# Welcome to my C++ boat application. 
Build a data structure of 20 boats. The data structure is built by flipping a coin and adding either a Rowboat or a Yacht based on the outcome of the coin flip. Print the list of boats.
Update the speed of each boat in the harbor using polymorphism and print the results.
Use three classes to demonstrate inheritance: Boat, Rowboat, Yacht and an implementation file as the driver program: Harbor.cpp.
